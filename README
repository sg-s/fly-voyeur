=== What this is ===

This is a set of MATLAB functions that allows you to quantify behaviour of flies in small arenas. This was originally developed to quantify courting and copulation behaviour of two flies in copulation assays, but can be extended to track any number of flies. 

Out of the box, this quantifies:

1. positions of all flies
2. orientations of all flies
3. times at which flies look at other flies
4. collision statisitcs between flies
5. times of copulation, if any, between flies
6. times of wing extension between flies.
