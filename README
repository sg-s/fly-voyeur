=== What this is ===

FlyVoyeur is a set of functions that allows you to track and quantify fly behavior. 
Originially developed for courtship assays, it can track the positions of flies, measure
their orientation, detect wing extension, and can handle extreme cases of fly collisions, 
and is resistant to flies going missing due to skipped frames or sudden movement. 

FlyVoyeur is fully parallelised, and can take advantage of CUDA-enabled GPUs to speed up tracking. 

Out of the box, this quantifies:

1. positions of all flies
2. orientations of all flies
3. times at which flies look at other flies
4. collision statisitcs between flies
5. times of copulation, if any, between flies
6. times of wing extension between flies.

Step 1. Annotate your video using FlyTrack.m 
Step 2. Track video using Track4.m 

=== A note on parallel processing and GPU acceleration ===

MATLAB's parallel toolbox is a disaster in some releases, based on the OS you run and the version of Java you have. 
If FlyVoyeur tells you parallel computation is not supported, you may have to resort to a number of tricks to get it
working. 

The same goes for GPU acceleration. On Mac OS X, MATLAB fails to tell the OS to switch to the discrete card, and hence 
initialisation of GPU resources fails.
